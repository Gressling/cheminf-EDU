# Nanoparticle Synthesis Optimization

**Note**: This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks: `DA_nanoparticles.ipynb` and `nanoparticle_CNN_python.ipynb`. The first notebook deals with statistical analysis (consisting of descriptive and explorative analysis) and contains a first draft for a CNN in the programming language R. The second notebook takes up the CNN and realises it in Python. How these notebooks can be executed can be read under [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-usage).

## Introduction

Nanoparticles play a critical role in various industries, ranging from medicine to environmental science, due to their unique properties. The synthesis of nanoparticles is a complex process that can be optimized by understanding the relationships between different synthesis parameters and the resulting particle size. This project aims to explore and predict the particle size of nanoparticles based on various synthesis parameters. Understanding these relationships can lead to more efficient production methods, better quality control, and advancements in nanoparticle applications. The study leverages a combination of linear regression, generalized additive models, and convolutional neural networks to model these relationships. By accurately predicting particle size, manufacturers can ensure consistency and quality in nanoparticle production. This project also highlights the importance of statistical and machine learning methods in optimizing industrial processes. The findings of this study have the potential to improve the scalability and efficiency of nanoparticle synthesis, ultimately contributing to advancements in nanotechnology and its applications.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict the particle size of nanoparticles based on various synthesis parameters such as temperature, pressure, time, and reactant concentrations.

### Discussion

The GAM results indicated that reactant B and C concentrations have significant non-linear effects on particle size. The linear regression model did not perform well, suggesting that non-linear relationships are crucial in this context. The CNN is expected to capture more complex interactions.

## Conclusion

The findings suggest that reactant concentrations, particularly reactant B and C, significantly influence nanoparticle size. The GAM model provided a better fit compared to the linear regression model, highlighting the importance of modelling non-linear relationships. This study demonstrates the potential for optimizing nanoparticle synthesis through advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Future Work

- **CNN Training**: Train and optimize the CNN to improve prediction accuracy. This includes gathering more data to ensure the input dimensions are sufficient for convolutional operations.
