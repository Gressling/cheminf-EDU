# Device Failure Prediction 

## Introduction
The Device Failure Prediction project aims to leverage AI techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to predict device failures in a laboratory setting. By analyzing calibration results and status fields, this project seeks to provide early warnings for potential device failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and reduced downtime.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using RNNs to estimate the likelihood of device failures. The specific goals include:

- Analyzing historical calibration data to identify patterns indicative of failure
- Developing a model that can predict device failures based on calibration results and operational status
- Providing actionable insights to improve maintenance schedules and device reliability

## Data Used
The project utilizes data from the following tables in the MySQL database:

- **c3_devicecalibration**: Contains calibration results and relevant dates for various devices.
- **c3_device_properties**: Includes properties and specifications of the devices.
- **c3_devices**: Lists the devices used in the laboratory with their operational status.
- **c3_devices_depr**: Contains deprecated or retired device information.
- **c3_devices_properties_temp**: Temporary properties of devices for ongoing calibration processes.

The dataset includes normal distributions for measurements and randomized dates for calibration relevance, making it suitable for RNN-based predictive analysis.

### Example Data

### Data Exploration and Visualization
- Analyze the relationships between calibration results, dates, and device statuses.
- Identify patterns and trends in calibration data that precede device failures.
- Visualize the calibration data to highlight potential indicators of failure.

### Model Development
- Preprocess the data by cleaning and normalizing the calibration results and statuses.
- Develop an RNN model to predict device failures based on historical calibration data.
- Train the RNN model using a training dataset and validate its performance using a separate validation dataset.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
