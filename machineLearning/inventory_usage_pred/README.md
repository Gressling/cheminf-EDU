This dataset records the usage of various chemicals by different laboratories. Specifically, each row represents an event of chemical usage or purchase and includes the following information:

1. **id**: A unique identifier for each event.
2. **amount_taken**: The amount of the chemical used or purchased.
3. **unit**: The unit of measurement for the chemical amount, such as liters (L), milligrams (mg), milliliters (ml), or grams (g).
4. **location**: The laboratory where the chemical was used or purchased (e.g., Lab_1, Lab_2).
5. **chemical**: The name of the chemical.
6. **CAS**: The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number, a unique identifier for chemicals.
7. **reason**: The reason for using or purchasing the chemical, such as "initial purchase" or a specific experiment (e.g., "Experiment_20").

This dataset can be used for several types of analyses:

- **Consumption Analysis**: Analyze the usage of chemicals by different laboratories and identify which chemicals are consumed the most.
- **Inventory Management**: Monitor the stock levels of chemicals to ensure timely replenishment.
- **Lab Activity Tracking**: Understand the activities of each laboratory and record and analyze the usage of chemicals in various experiments.
- **Safety Management**: Assess and manage safety risks based on the types and amounts of chemicals used.

These analyses can help lab managers optimize chemical usage and inventory, improve operational efficiency, and enhance safety in the laboratories.
