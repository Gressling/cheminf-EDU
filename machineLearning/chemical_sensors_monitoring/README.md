# Sensors Monitoring

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset collected from a sensor over a period of time. The dataset includes information about sensor readings, temperature, humidity, and degradation levels recorded at different timestamps.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following fields:

- **SensorID**: A unique identifier for each sensor.
- **Timestamp**: The specific date and time when the data was recorded.
- **SensorValue**: The numerical value recorded by the sensor at the given timestamp. 
- **Temperature**: The ambient temperature in degrees Celsius at the time the data was recorded.
- **Humidity**: he absolute humidity at the time the data was recorded, measured in grams of water vapor per cubic meter of air (g/mÂ³). 
- **DegradationLevel**: A measure indicating the level of degradation, where a higher value represents greater degradation.
