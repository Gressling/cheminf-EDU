# Envirnonmental Pollution Prediction

## Purpose

This dataset contains environmental data for various locations at different timestamps. Each row represents a specific location at a particular time, with measurements for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), and particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers (PM10). The dataset also includes the location, timestamp, and image URL associated with each entry.
