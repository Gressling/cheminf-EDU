# Spectral Analysis
## Introduction

The HPLC-data set is a collection of intensities, probably emitted wave lenghts, recorded at different points in time from a starting point. These intensities with their respective times are assigned to a sample. This data set is aimed at analysis via machine learning methods.

## Objective

By employing machine learning methods - e.g. analysis via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOCV) - ideal timings or similarites could be derived from the data set. Time series analysis on individual compounds would be possible also.

## Features

**Compound**: named tested sample
**Retention_Time**: time interval from starting point of experiment
**Intensity**: measured wave length

## Sample Data
