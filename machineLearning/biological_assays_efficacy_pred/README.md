# Biological Assays Efficacy Prediction
 
## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the efficacy of biological assays. Biological assays are crucial experiments in biological research and drug development, used to measure the effects of a substance on a living organism or cells. Accurate prediction of assay outcomes can significantly accelerate the drug discovery process, reduce costs, and enhance the development of effective treatments.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine the efficacy of various compounds in biological assays. The model seeks to address the challenge of predicting assay outcomes based on compound features and assay conditions, potentially leading to more efficient drug screening and discovery processes.

## Data Used
Source of the Data  
The data for this project is hypothetically sourced from a public repository such as the PubChem BioAssay database, which contains a wealth of bioactivity data for various chemical compounds.  

Data Collection Methods  
The data is collected through high-throughput screening (HTS) methods, where large libraries of chemical compounds are tested for their biological activity.

Data Size and Structure  
Size: The dataset consists of approximately 10,000 assay results, each containing detailed information on compound properties and assay conditions.  
Structure: Each record in the dataset includes features such as compound ID, assay ID, chemical descriptors, assay conditions, and the measured efficacy.  

## Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicate entries and handling missing values.  
Normalization: Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity.  
Feature Engineering: Creation of additional relevant features based on existing data.  
Splitting: Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets.  

## Features
The model leverages a set of features from the dataset to predict the quantitative outcomes of biological assays effectively. These features include:

- **Assay ID**: Unique identifier for each assay, providing a reference to the specific experimental setup.
- **Compound Name**: The name of the chemical or biological compound tested in the assay.
- **Target** (not ML target): The biological target (e.g., protein, enzyme) that the assay is designed to interact with, which is crucial for understanding the specificity and action mechanism of the compound.
- **Assay Type**: The type of assay conducted, which can influence the interpretation of results (e.g., inhibition assay, binding assay).
- **Measurement Type**: The method used to measure the assay's outcome (e.g., absorbance, fluorescence), which affects the data's reliability and precision.
- **Efficacy Class**: Categorical assessment of the compound's efficacy, providing context for the quantitative results.
- **Date Performed**: The date the assay was conducted, useful for tracking experiments and analyzing time-based trends.

These features are selected to provide a comprehensive view of the conditions and variables that influence the assay outcomes, enhancing the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

## Prediction Target
The prediction target of this machine learning model is the **Assay Result**, which is a continuous variable representing the quantitative outcome of the biological assays. This target is critical for evaluating the exact magnitude of response elicited by the compound under specific experimental conditions. Predicting the assay result enables researchers and developers to quantify the effectiveness of compounds, facilitating decisions in further drug development and refinement processes.

This model focuses on delivering precise predictions that can aid in detailed analysis and optimization of compounds in drug discovery and biological research.
